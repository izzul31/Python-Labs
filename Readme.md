Programming is a great way to get insights about math concepts. You’ll see here tips and tricks to learn math, more specifically linear algebra, from a coding perspective. You’ll see the relationship between Numpy functions and linear algebra abstract concepts.

At the end of this mini-tutorial, you’ll know what are arrays ,vectors & matrices, and why they are the core of machine learning and data science.. so lets gets started

## What you will learn
✅Array are Homogeneous Data Structure<br>
✅Multiple equal length vector stacked as table<br>
✅Wide range of collection operations<br>
✅Data tranformation and its properties.<br>
✅Lots of hands stuff and more...

## Libraries required 
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install below

```bash
pip install numpy
```

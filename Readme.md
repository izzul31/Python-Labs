# Numpy for Mathematics for Machine Learning subject

Programming is a great way to get insights about math concepts. You’ll see here tips and tricks to learn math, more specifically linear algebra, from a coding perspective. You’ll see the relationship between Numpy functions and linear algebra abstract concepts such as arrays ,vectors & matrices.

...These concepts are the core of machine learning and data science.

## What you will learn
✅Array are Data Structure that can represent vectors & matrices<br>
✅Multiple equal length vector stacked as table<br>
✅Operations that can be done on vectors & matrices<br>
✅Data tranformation and its properties.<br>

## Libraries required 
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install below

```bash
pip install numpy
```
